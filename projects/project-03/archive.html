<h2>Description </h2> 
<p>PLAY & PAINT is street furniture designed to foster communal creativity while encouraging social distancing. The proposal aims to take advantage of the distribution of ‘sidewalk chalk’ and allows residents of Newburgh to watch their collective efforts culminate into a shared mural. The profiles of any of the unfolded geometries can be produced economically using any type of available sheet material (corrugated cardboard/large sheets of plastic), the geometry folds easily and fixes using added ‘tabs.’ Before folding, specific surfaces are painted using ‘chalkboard paint.’ Once folded these geometries offer themselves up for play but they can also be used as dividers, temporary tables, or casual seating. One component of the project involves marking the ground in order to place the objects a safe distance from one another and to encourage distancing visually for all users. The objects stack easily, and can always be unfolded for storage purposes. PAINT & PLAY brings a new meaning to collaborative street art that can be enjoyed anywhere and at any time.
